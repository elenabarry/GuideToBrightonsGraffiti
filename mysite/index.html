		</header>
		<h5> Published on <time datetime="2017-12-12"><strong> December 12th, 2017</strong></time></h5>
		
	<h4>Testing</h4>
	<p>In Steve Krug's book ‘Don’t Make me think’ <a href="#ref31">(2000, p.139-153)</a>, he discusses the different ways in which 
	you can test a website and the benefits of doing so.<b> Testing informs your judgement</b> by showing that people use the web 
	in different ways. </p>
	<p>Two methods of testing:</p>
	
	<ol>
	<li><b>Testing comparable sites.</b> These sites could be similar in style, organisation or features. This can be done during the design stage. </li>
	<li><b>Watch people while they use the website.</b> This allows you to see where people run into trouble. Krug suggests that 3 to 4 people are ideal.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>After working on my website for so long, I needed a fresh pair of eyes, so applied the second method of testing and
	asked my friends and family to have a look at my website. There was a consensus for <b>more visual aids</b> and my friend who studied
	graphic design suggested that I should <b>line up my boxes</b> on my guide page. I took their advice and applied it to my website.</p>
	
	<h4>Evaluation</h4>

	<p>I have tested all three pages of my website with excellent outcomes. I have made sure that my site is <b>compliant with W3C HTML and
	CSS web standards</b> and that my website displays on different browsers and is compatible with various devices.</p>
	
	<p>I have made sure that my website is <b>accessible to people with disabilities</b>. For deaf people, I have used 'alt' or 'figcaption' tags
	to describe my images, and for people who are visually impaired, I have made sure my text is clear by using black text on top of a white background,
	and large, high-quality images.</p>
	
	<p>Through the process of making my site, I have discovered how to use HTML and CSS to create a responsive website.
	With independent study, I have learnt about the <b>legal and ethical issues</b> surrounding using 3rd party assets and code.
	I have made sure that I have permission to use anything that is not my own and have referenced any third party. </p>
	
	<p>Although, I was unable to find out what was causing a small uploading error, my website is still mobile friendly. I have gone into more detail 
	about this error in week 10.</p>
	
	<p>I have enjoyed creating this site and have learnt by applying techniques gathered from my lab tutorials and independent study.
	I am looking forward to developing more sites in the future.</p>

		<h4>Reflection</h4>
		
		<p>These are side by side screenshots of all three pages on my phone. After taking these screenshots,
		I noticed that the active link on my menu disappears into the background. I fixed this by using a bright red
		colour to contrast against the black.</p>

</figure>
		
		<p>I fixed the uneven margins either side of my heading on my guide page. I did this by targeting sections of my webpage with different
		colours and by experimenting using different content either side of the problem areas. <b>I discovered that the individual galleries were 
		disrupting my margins.</b> I fixed the problem by bringing all of the photographs on my page together to create one large gallery. 
		This not only solved the problem, it made my page more concise by getting rid of unnecessary length which could frustrate users.</p>
		
		<p>After creating my gallery, I discovered that the place links, linked to the writing at the bottom of the image so that you couldn't
		see the image without scrolling up. I have swapped the title so that it is now on top of the picture.</p>

		<h4>z-index</h4>
		
		<p> Boxes can overlap. The elements later in the HTML code can sit on top of earlier elements. 
		<b>The z-index property allows you to control which elements sit on top</b>.
		The higher the value used the closer the element is to the front <a href="#ref6">(Duckett, 2011, p.369)</a>.</p>
		
		<h4>Position Property</h4>
        <p>Positioned elements are either relative, absolute, fixed or sticky <a href="#ref29">(Mozilla Developer Network, 2018)</a>. 
		Using positions, I was able to <b>overlap my banner with a header</b>. I gave my heading, a position of 'absolute' and gave my
		banner, a position of 'relative' which shifted my banner to the bottom. However, I discovered that problems arose from doing so.
		Google and other search engines regard headings highly and making the banner and text responsive proved to be difficult.</p>

<h4>Testing mobile friendliness</h4>

        <p>I started to test my website and came across these errors on my guide site.
         I have since removed the interactive google map and have replaced it with a screenshot version. However,'up.png' doesn't exist. This error 
         also shows up on my learning journal. I have looked in my computer, all my HTML and stylesheets and in my images folder but <b>'up.png' is nowhere
         to be seen</b>.</p>

<h4>Testing mobile speed</h4>

        <p>I mentioned in week 5 about <b>paragraph drop caps reducing the speed</b> of my website. 
        The score below is with paragraph drop caps inserted into my guide page. However, when I took the paragraph drop caps out
        my guide page speed was rated excellent. I am going to try to reduce the amount of drop caps I am using to see
        if I can increase my score. If I can not get my score up, I will remove the paragraph drop caps altogether 
        as it <b>is not worth losing 10&percnt; of visitors</b>.</p>

<h4>Validating CSS</h4>

        <p>I have validated all three pages and have found no errors! I have got two <b>warnings from using '::-webkit-scrollbar'</b> which is a 
         CSS pseudo-element that affects the style of a scrollbar. I am getting warnings from using it because it is non-standard. 
		 I am using it so that a scrollbar will show up on my table and my message box on an iOS device. </p>

		<h4>Reflection</h4>
		
		<p>I have mainly been using my laptop to work on my website. When I looked at my site on a lab computer, I realised that the <b>colours</b>
		I had chosen on my laptop looked completely different on the lab computers. The wrapper looked neon green! To fix this, I  used both my laptop
		and a lab computer simultaneously to change the colours so that they worked in harmony on both machines.</p>
		
		<p>The heading for each of my posts on my guide has <b>inconsistent margins</b>. The problem has been targeted with coloured sections. </p>

		<h4>HTML Forms</h4>
		
		<p><b>HTML5 forms help to improve user experience</b> and helps to cut down the amount of JavaScript that a web developer must write when carrying
		out form validation <a href="#ref28">(Clark, 2017)</a>.Important forms include:</p>
		
		<ul>
		<li><b>Search:</b> Search is the most commonly used form, from google searches to searching an actual website. I tried adding a search bar to my page, but I realised I needed the corresponding JavaScript.</li>
		<li><b>URL:</b> A browser will check if the entry to this field is correct. If the form is not entered the browser presents an error message.</li>
		<li><b>Number:</b> You can expand this by adding a min and max range. 
		</ul>
		
		<p>I experimented with my contact form. I centered my text, input boxes and ‘textarea’ to fit my theme. I made the 'textarea' so people
		could write longer messages with ease. I then added <b>responsive CSS to target the ‘textarea’ so that its contence would not overflow on smaller devices</b>.  </p>

		<h4>Reflection</h4>
		
		<p>I used <b>Harvard referencing</b> and added a link to each of my references within the writing to its primary reference. 
		If the reference was a website, I added a link to that site in the primary references which open in a new tab. 
		I resolved my problem with <b>overflow</b> by adding a scrollbar to my references by using the CSS ‘overflow: auto’.  
		After taking this screenshot I then used the margin attribute in CSS to put space around the individual references so that they are
		clear to the reader.</p>

<h4>Writing Scannable Text for the Web</h4>

        <p>I made my text scannable with subheadings, keywords in bold and lists to separate information out and to make it 
        more user friendly. At first, I made every keyword bold, but I found this made my text look cluttered. The University of Wisconsin law school website
        recommended an inverted pyramid style. This is where each post starts with a conclusion, followed by the most important supporting information,
        and ends by giving the background information <a href="#ref26">(Law.wisc.edu, 2017)</a>. Although, this format would not be right for each of my blog
        posts, I will try and create <b>a clear visual hierarchy</b> on each page, where I begin with an overall reflection of the week, followed by my
        independent reading and how I learnt and applied it to my website in chronological order.</p>

<h4>Omit needless words</h4>

        <p>In chapter 5 of ‘Don’t make me think’. Krug talks about writing for the web. He suggests that <b>‘happy talk’</b> 
        found in introductions and unnecessary instructions <b>‘needs to die’</b> <a href="#ref29">(Krug, 2000, p.45-48)</a>. 
        He explains the benefits of getting rid of unnecessary words:</p>

 <ol>
  <li>'It reduces the noise level of the page.'<a href="#ref29">(Krug, 2000, p.45-48)</a></li>
  <li>'It makes the useful content more prominent.'<a href="#ref29">(Krug, 2000, p.45-48)</a></li>
  <li>'It makes the pages shorter, allowing users to see more of each page at a glance without scrolling.'<a href="#ref29">(Krug, 2000, p.45-48)</a></li>
 </ol> 
 
<h4>Layout</h4>
 
        <p>In chapter 15 of Duckett's book 'HTML & CSS', Duckett <a href="#ref6">(2011, pp.361-368)</a> discusses layout and how to control where each 
		element sits on a page. Each HTML element is treated as if it is in its own box.There are two types of boxes:</p>
 
 <p><b>Block-level boxes:</b> Act as the main building blocks. They start on a new line. E.g. &lt;h1&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; 
 <p><b>Inline boxes:</b> Flow between surrounding text. E.g. &lt;img&gt; &lt;b&gt; &lt;i&gt;
		
<dl>
  <dt>
    <strong><dfn>
     Normal Flow
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd> Every block-level element appears on a new line.</dd>
  <dt>
   <strong><dfn>
     Relative positioning
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>This shifts and element to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed.</dd>	
	 <dt>
    <strong><dfn>
     Absolute positioning 
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd> This positions the elements in relation to its containing element. It does not affect the position of any surrounding elements and the elements move as users scrolls.</dd>
 <dt>
    <strong><dfn>
     Fixed positioning
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd> This is a form of absolute positioning that positions the elements in relation to the browser window. The elements do not move as users scroll.</dd>
 <dt>
    <strong><dfn>
     Floating Elements
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd> Allows you to position element to the far left of right of a containing box.</dd>
</dl>  
	
		<h4>Creating a multi-column layout</h4>
		
		<p>You can split a body of content into many different columns by using the <b>column-count property</b> to specify the number of columns you want.
		The column-count property divides your content equally into that number of columns. E.g.</p>
		
		<p>section &lcub;</p>
		<p>column-count: 3&semi;</p> 
		<p>&rcub;</p> 
		<p>Or you can use column-width property. The browser uses the columns that best-fit this specified length. </p> 
		<p>section &lcub;</p> 
		<p>column-width: 25rem&semi;</p> 
		<p>&rcub;</p>
		<p><a href="#ref27">(Mills, 2013, pp.245-249)</a></p> 
		<h4>Multiple Stylesheets</h4>
		
		<p>To change the layout style on my guide page, I have used a separate stylesheet for my index page. <b>Utilising another stylesheet is common</b>
		in web development. Some authors might use a stylesheet to control the layout and another to control fonts and colours 
		<a href="#ref6">(Duckett, 2011, p.395)</a>.</p>

		I couldn't get the video to display on my page. I fixed this problem by creating a new folder for videos within ‘mysite’ folder, and then
		uploading it from the folder.</p>

<h4>Copyright</h4>

         <p>Copyright is a form of <b>intellectual property</b>. It gives the  creator exclusive rights to its use and distribution.
		 According to <a href="#ref22">(Gov.uk, 2018)</a>, you get automatic copyright protection. You can use the copyright symbol (&copy;),
		 your name and the year of creation to mark your work. I have included it at the bottom of my site. 
		 Using this mark doesn't affect the level of protection. Copyright laws vary by country. However, many aspects of national copyright
		 laws have been standardised through international copyright agreement such as the Berne Convention. The length of time copyright
		 stands for varies from the type of work. Copyright typically last a minimum of 25 years for photographs and 50 years for most written pieces.</p>


<h4>HTML & CSS: Images</h4> 

         <p>In 'HTML & CSS', Duckett <a href="#ref23">(2011, pp.109-112)</a> suggests saving images that contain multiple colours as jpegs.
         If the image contains few colours, e.g. a logo, then you should save the image as a png.</p>


 <h4>Responsive Web Design</h4> 
 
         <p>I learnt that responsive web design reduces loading speed. Using <b>CSS as an alternative for decorative effects</b> will reduce the weight
         of the page and therefore, its loading time. Each separate HTTP request that a web page makes will add to the loading 
         time of the web page <a href="#ref25">(Peterson, 2014, pp.136-138)</a>.</p>
 
         <p>To increase the loading speed of my site, I have used photoshop to resize my images to the maximum size I would like them to be displayed.
		 I have also grouped my pictures together on my guide page by using a flex gallery.</p>
		 
 <h4>Screen Size</h4>
 
         <p>There are many different sized screens which show varying amounts of information. The variation of screen sizes available means that my website 
         <b>design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens</b>. Web designers tend to create pages of around 960-1000 wide as most users 
         will be able to see designs this wide on their screens <a href="#ref23">(Duckett, 2011, pp.377-386).</a> </p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <strong><dfn>
     Fixed width layouts
    </dfn></strong>

       <p>I experimented with the <b>wrapper</b> further and discovered I could use it in a way that the white background of the 
       wrapper would only be visible for each post. I realise that this is not the aesthetic of a professional or an easy
       to navigate website. Playing around with these features allowed me to understand the individual values and properties in more detail.</p>

       <p>This image shows how my website looked like after completing the lab. The page does not look as clean as I would like it to be and my CSS page
	   has become cluttered. I am going to go back to the beginning and use what I have learnt through experimentation to build up my CSS.</p>

<h4>Introduction to CSS Layout</h4>

       <p>For this week’s independent learning I looked at ‘Introduction to CSS Layout’: Normal layout flow </p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <strong><dfn>
     The position property
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd> A static position is the default in the normal flow, but you can cause elements to be laid out differently using other values.</dd>
  <dt>
   <strong><dfn>
     Floats
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd> Applying a float value such as left can cause block level elements to line up alongside one another rather than sit on top of one another.</dd>
   <dt>
   <strong><dfn>
      The display property
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd> Standard values such as block, inline or inline-block can change how elements behave in normal flow.</dd>
  </dl>
	
	<p><a href="#ref19">(Mozilla Developer Network, 2017)</a></p>
	
<h4>Floats</h4>

       <p>Using a float is a technique that <b>allows the elements to float to the left or right of one another</b>,
       rather than the default of sitting on top of one another. The primary uses of floats are to layout columns
       and float text around an image. It is essential to clear floats afterwards as all the content below the float
       that isn’t floated itself will wrap around the floated elements <a href="#ref20">(Mozilla Developer Network, 2017)</a>. 
	   In week three I used this technique to float an image to the right of my text.</p>
	   
<h4>Using Media Queries</h4>

       <p>Media queries are <b>used to give specific characteristics to a given user agent, output device, or environment 
	   </b><a href="#ref21">(Mozilla Developer Network, 2017)</a>. I am currently using media queries in my CSS to target different screen sizes.
	   You can create a media query that depends on multiple conditions by using logical operators: 'not', 'and' and 'only.'</p>

<ul>
<li>The keyword <b>‘and’</b> combines a media feature with a media type or other media feature. </li>
<li>The keyword <b>‘not’</b> inverts the meaning of an entire media query.</li>
<li>The keyword <b>‘only’</b> prevents older browsers that do not support media queries with media features from applying the queries style. </li> 
</ul>

<h4>Reflection</h4>

         <p>This week I experimented using <b>repeated images as my background</b>. I used a picture that was initially of Brighton beach so
		 that it would be cohesive with the theme of my guide on Brighton Palace Pier. Using photoshop, I decreased the saturation of the background
		 image so that everything inside the wrapper would stand out in contrast. This is so that the background will not distract the reader from the text.
		 I then experimented moving the wrapper element further down my page. I did this so that I could use my background image as a background to the
		 title of my page. I realised that I could create an image of my title in photoshop and then include it inside the wrapper.</p>

<figure>
<img src="images/title.jpg" alt="" />
<figcaption>Image version of title<br/>
<small>Own image; Elena Barry</small> 
</figcaption>
</figure>

         <p>I used <b>graduating colours for my post titles</b>. I decided to limit using graduating colours to my post titles as my text could become
		 harder to read in larger areas. Using a section tag I changed the background of my blog posts back to white to give the reader more clarity.
		 Using W3C's website <a href="#ref30">(W3schools, 2017)</a>, I investigated different ways of displaying my navigation bar.</p>

<h4>Box Model Recap</h4>

         <p>I looked at ‘Styling boxes: Guide: Box model recap’. <b>Margin Collapsing</b> is when two boxes touch against one another. 
         The distance between the boxes is the value of the largest of the two touching margins.
         Content does not always fit within the allowed size which means that the content overflows the box. The <b>‘overflow’</b> 
         property controls this <a href="#ref17">(Mozilla Developer Network, 2017)</a>.</p> 

         <p>My references are currently overflowing so I will use different overflow values to see which style will fit my website most appropriately.</p> 

<dl>
  <dt>
    <strong><dfn>
      Auto
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>If there is too much content, the overflowing content is hidden, and scroll bars are shown to let the user scroll to see all the content. I have used this on my table.</dd>
  <dt>
   <strong><dfn>
      Hidden
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd> If there is too much content, the overflowing content is shown outside of the box.</dd>
   <dt>
   <strong><dfn>
      Outline
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd> The outline of a box is something that looks like a border but which is not part of the box model. It behaves like the border but is drawn on top of the box without changing the size of the box.</dd>
  </dl>
 

         <p>I looked at changing <b>background styles</b> using CSS. 
         It is essential to set a default background colour, I have set mine to the orange. <b>Background image gradient</b> comes in two forms:</p> 
	
<ol>
<li>Linear gradients that go from one line straight across to another.</li>
<li>Radical gradients which radiate out from a single point.</li>
</ol> 
	
         <p>I experimented with linear gradients and decided on ‘background-image: linear-gradient(to top, #A8D0EC, #FFA259 25px, #FFBB59 50px);’. 
		 I started out using ‘repeating-linear-gradient’ however when I looked at this style on my phone the repetition of the colours made the 
		 content unreadable.</p>
	
	<h4>Paragraph with drop caps</h4>
	
	     <p>This week I experimented using paragraph drop caps. I love the way it makes my page look! Unfortunately, it increases my page's loading time,
	     and the more I use, the slower my web page becomes. As my guide page is aimed at new students, the aesthetic of my guide page is slightly more important
	     than the aesthetic of my learning journal. My guide page will also have less
	     content to load than my learning journal. For these reasons, <b>I have decided to only
	     use paragraph drop caps for my guide page</b>.</p>

	<h4>Styling Tables</h4>
	
	     <p>I then looked at ‘Styling tables’ <a href="#ref18">(Mozilla Developer Network, 2017).</a> After reading this page, 
	     I removed the line of CSS that was in my HTML index page and replaced it with new rulesets in my stylesheet.</p>

		<h3 id="week4">Week 4: CSS Basics</h3>
		</header>
		<h5> Published on <time datetime="2017-10-24"><strong> October 24th, 2017</strong></time></h5>
		
		<h4>Reflection</h4>
		
		<p>I attempted styling with CSS for the first time. I used different light colours and highlighted each post title and its text. 
		I have tried to use contrasting colours so that someone with <b>impaired vision</b> or colour blindness would still be able to read my contents easily.</p>
		
		<h4>How CSS Works</h4>
		
		<p>I looked at ‘How CSS works’ <a href="#ref12">(Mozilla Developer Network, 2017)</a>. The browser converts HTML and CSS into the Document 
		Object Model which represents the document in the computer’s memory. 
		It combines the document’s content with its style. The browser displays the contents of the DOM. </p>
		
		<h4>CSS Syntax</h4>
		<p>I then looked at ‘CSS syntax’ <a href="#ref13">(Mozilla Developer Network, 2017)</a>.</p>
		
<dl>
  <dt>
    <strong><dfn>
      Properties
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>Are human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic feature you want to change.</dd>
  <dt>
   <strong><dfn>
      Values
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>a value which indicates how you want to change those stylistic features.</dd>
   <dt>
   <strong><dfn>
      CSS declaration
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>Is a property paired with a value.</dd>
   <dt>
     <strong><dfn>
      A ruleset 
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>Is the selector and declaration block.</dd>
  </dl>
  
  <figure>
<img src="images/csssyntax.jpg" alt="" />

</figure>
  
<h4>Values and Units</h4>
  
        <p>I looked at CSS ‘Values and Units' <a href="#ref14">(Mozilla Developer Network, 2017)</a>. <b>Relative units</b> are relative to the current
		elements font-size or viewport size.</p>

        <p><b>em:</b> 1 em is the same as the font-size of the current element (width of a capital M). I have converted my px sizes into em in my stylesheet
		using an online converter.</p>
  
        <p><b>A liquid layout</b> could be used to ensure that a standard document will always fit on the screen and look ok across
        varying mobile device screen sizes. I would like my website to achieve this. </p>
	

	    <p><b>Colours</b> can be represented as <b>hexadecimal values</b>. Each pair of value represents one of the channels red, green and blue. 
	    I have used hexadecimal values created by a CSS colour picker online.</p> 
	
	    <p>I found that there are other ways of representing colour. 
	    <b>RGB</b> is where each channel is represented by a number between 0-255 e.g. rgb(0,0,255);</p>
	
	    <p><b>HSL</b> is slightly less well supported than RGB. It was implemented after interest from designers.</p>
	
<ol>
<li>Hue- the base shade of the colour. The value is between 0-360.</li>
<li>Saturation- 0-100%</li>
<li>Lightness-0-100%</li>

</ol>

        <p><b>RGBA and HSLA</b> let you set the transparency you want the colour to have. Value from 0 – 1.  1 being opaque. 
        This is something that I would like to look into further so that I can apply it to my own website. </p>

        <p>Then I looked at ‘Cascade and Inheritance’ (Mozilla Developer Network, 2017). 
        <b>Specificity</b> is a measure of how specific a selector is; how many elements it could match.</p> 
	
<ul>
<li>Element selectors have low specificity.</li>
<li>Class selectors have higher specificity.</li>
<li>ID selectors have the highest specificity.</li>
</ul>

        <p>To make sure that a certain declaration will always win over all others use ‘!important’. Only use it when you must.
		'!important' overrides ID selectors. </p> 
	
        <p>If multiple competing selectors have the same importance and specificity, source order decides hierarchy.</p>	

        <p><b>Inheritance</b> is the idea is that some property values applied to an element will be inherited and some won’t.
		E.g. font-family and colour are inherited. Margin, padding, border and background image is not inherited.</p>

<h4>Document and Website Structure</h4>

         <p>For my independent work this week I looked ‘Document and Website Structure’ <a href="#ref9">(Mozilla Developer Network, 2017)</a>.
         <b>Non-semantic wrappers:</b> Using &lt;div&gt; and &lt;span&gt; elements are a great way to wrap the same content together when you can’t find 
         an ideal semantic element to group them in.  I have used a &lt;div&gt; element for my table and have used the class attribute ‘table container’ so 
         that I can later target it with CSS: &lt;div class="table-container"&gt;. The problem with div elements is that they can 
         clutter HTML and can have a hard time updating and maintaining your document.</p>

<p><b>&lt;br&gt;</b> creates a line break which I might choose to break some of my paragraphs up with. 
<b>&lt;hr&gt;</b> creates a horizontal rule that shows a thematic change in the text. </P>

<h4>Creating Hyperlinks</h4>

         <p>I then looked at ‘Creating hyperlinks’ <a href="#ref10">(Mozilla Developer Network, 2017)</a>. 
         <b>Document fragments</b> is where you can link to a specific part of an HTML document. 
         I touched upon this concept in my last entry. I have used this earlier in my learning Journal,
         linking my page after each entry to the top of my website.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <strong><dfn>
      Absolute URL
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>Will always point to the same location, no matter where it is used.</dd>
  <dt>
    <strong><dfn>
      Relative URL
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>Will point to a location that is relative to the file you are linking from. </dd>
  </dl>

  <h4>Content Model</h4>
  
          <p>This week I began watching the HTML and CSS playlist on ‘Lynda’ <a href="#ref11">(Lynda.com - from LinkedIn, 2017)</a>. 
          Where I learnt more about the ‘Content Model'. The ‘Content Model’ 
          <b>defines the type of content expected of an element and controls the syntax rules</b>.</P>

 <p>The 7 main models are:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>
    <strong><dfn>
      Metadata Content
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>Sets up the format.</dd>
  <dt>
    <strong><dfn>
      Embedded
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>Is anything that is imported into the document</dd>
   <dt>
   <strong><dfn>
      Interactive Content
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>Are things that the user clicks on etc.</dd>
   <dt>
     <strong><dfn>
      Heading
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>Defines the heading of a section.</dd>
   <dt>
     <strong><dfn>
      Phrasing
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd> Is text and elements that are used in formatting</dd>
   <dt>
     <strong><dfn>
      Flow content
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>Elements that are involved in normal flow.</dd>
   <dt>
     <strong><dfn>
      Sectioning content
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>Defines the scope of sections.</dd>   
  </dl>
   
         <p><b>‘Pre’</b> stands for preformatted. 
         &lt;pre>&lt;/pre&gt; tags makes text into a monospace font and respects whitespace. 
         I will use this in my future posts when I haven’t decided the format of my text yet.</P>

<h4>ISO 8601</h4>

        <p>This week I looked at ‘ISO 8601’ <a href="#ref4">(En.wikipedia.org, 2017)</a>. ISO 8601 is an <b>international standard representing dates and
		times</b>. It was first published in 1988. Its intention is to avoid misinterpretation of the representation of date and 
		times from different countries’ formats.</p>

        <p>The general principle is that date and time values are ordered from the largest to the smallest unit of time.
         Each date and time value has a fixed number of digits that must be padded with leading zeros.</p>

        <p>I have used this format when expressing ‘datetime’ &lt;time datetime="2017-11-07"&gt;.</p>

<h4>Character Entities</h4>

        <p>I have used a large reference of character entities <a href="#ref5">(Dev.w3.org, 2017)</a> 
        to change the ‘&lt;' and ‘&gt;’ characters around example tags so that the browser doesn’t confuse them with actual tags.
        I have also used these character entities to temporarily change the title of my blog.</p>

<figure>

<h4>HTML & CSS</h4>

        <p>I read about <b>text, lists and links</b> in 'HTML & CSS' <a href="#ref6">(Duckett, 2011, pp.40-90)</a>. I discovered the difference between
		bold &lt;b&gt; and strong &lt;strong&gt; tags and italic &lt;i&gt; and emphasis &lt;em&gt;  tags. Strong is used to indicate that its contents have
        strong importance and will show its contents in bold. &lt;em&gt; indicates emphasis that subtly changes the 
        meaning of a sentence. The element will show its contents in italic. A screen reader will be able to recognise these different tags and act 
		accordingly.</p>

        <p>I am currently using the <b>&lt;cite&gt;</b> element when referencing my independent learning.
        I found that the element <b>&lt;dfn&gt;</b> is a defining instance and can be used to explain new terminology which
        some browsers will show its contents in italics. I will use this tag below for defining the three types of lists.</p>

        <p>There are <b>three types of lists</b>:</p>
 
<dl>
  <dt>
    <strong><dfn>
      Ordered Lists
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>Is where each item in the list is numbered.I have used this list to display the three fundamental technologies of the web's foundation in my first learning journal entry. </dd>
  <dt>
    <strong><dfn>
      Unordered lists
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>Is where all items in the list start with a bullet point.</dd>
   <dt>
    <strong><dfn>
      Definition lists
    </dfn></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd>Are made up of a set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms. This is an example of a definition list.</dd>
</dl>

         <p><b>Nested lists</b> involve multiple lists within another. You do this by adding another &lt;ul &gt;  or &lt;ol &gt; element
         after an item in the previous list. Browsers display nested lists indented further than the parent list.
         In nested unordered lists, the browser will usually change the style of the bullet point too.</p>
		 
         <p>You can <b>link to a specific part of another page</b> as long as the page you are linking to has id attributes that identify specific parts
         of the page, you can simply add the same syntax to the end of the link for that page.</p>

		<h4>Web Standards</h4>
				
		  <p>For my independent learning this week I first looked at ‘Web Standards’ <a href="#ref1">(Mozilla Developer Network, 2017)</a>. 
		  This site states that web standards are <b>designed to benefit the most number of people,
		  to be usable on the most substantial amount of devices while ensuring the long-term viability of any document</b>. Overall building with these standards simplifies
		  and lowers production cost. Using current web standards allows your website to be compatible with older web browsers. </p>
 
       <h4>Getting Started with HTML</h4>
 
          <p>I then looked at 'Getting started with HTML' <a href="#ref2">(Mozilla Developer Network, 2017)</a>. Hypertext Markup Language tells your browser 
          <b>how to structure the web pages</b>. It consists of elements which you can use to make specific content to appear or act in a certain way. </p>

          <p><b>Nesting elements</b> involves putting elements inside other elements. Elements need to be inserted properly as there is a hierarchy. 
		  For example, I have used the tags &lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;  within &lt;time&gt; &lt;/time&gt; tags within &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt; tags when 
		  formatting the date and time of publish for each of my learning journal posts.</p>
 
<figure>		
<img src="images/nestingelements.jpg" alt="" />
<figcaption>Nesting Elements<br/>

</figcaption>
</figure>

           <p><b>Empty elements</b> use a single tag and are usually used to insert or embed something in the document. For example, I have used the
		   &lt;img&gt; and &lt;meta&gt; tags in my website.</p>
 
          <p><b>White space collapsing</b>- The HTML parser reduces whitespace down to a single space when rendering the code. 
          For example, if I didn’t put my paragraphs in &lt;p&gt; and &lt;/p&gt; tags, the browser would display each post as one block of writing.</p>
 
 <h4>History of the Web</h4>
 
          <p>Then I looked at the ‘History of the Web' <a href="#ref3">(World Wide Web Foundation, 2017)</a>.
          During 1989 millions of computers were being connected through the internet. British computer scientist <b>Sir Tim Barners-Lee</b> realised
		  they could share information by exploiting an emerging technology called hypertext.</p>
 
          <p>In March 1989 Barnes-Lee laid out his vision for what would become the web in a document called <b>"Information Management: A proposal"</b>.
		  His boss at the time, Mike Sendall, noted the words <b>"Vague but exciting"</b> on the cover.</p>
  
          <p>By October of 1990, Barnes-Lee had written the <b>three fundamental technologies</b> that remain the foundation of today's web.</p>
 
<ol>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>URI- Is an address that is unique and is used to identify each resource on the web.</li>
<li>HTTP- Allows for the retrieval of linked resources from across the web.	</li>
</ol>

          <p>By the end of 1990, the first web page was served on the open internet. Barnes-Lee advocated ensuring that CERN would agree to make the
		  <b>underlying code available on a royalty-free basis forever</b>.</p>
		  
          <p>Barnes-Lee moved from CERN to the Massachusetts Institute of technology in 1994 and found the <b>www consortium (W3C)</b>,
		  an international community devoted to developing open web standards, where he remains the director today.</p>
